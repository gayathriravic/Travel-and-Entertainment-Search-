# Travel-and-Entertainment-Search-

I created a webpage that allows you to search for places information using the Google Places API. The results will be displayed in a tabular format.
The page will also provide reviews and photos for the selected place.
Back-end: PHP
Front-end: HTML,CSS, JavaScript
